# Web Scraping Application - Using BeautifulSoup4 and Python


Greetings all,
    <br><br>A Web scraper is an application used to script websites and get information out of it.

BeautifulSoup4 is a powerful yet simple python library used to extract and parse information from the HTML code of a website and present it to Python in a way that it can read and represent the data to use.<br><br>

This enables us to do a lot of Data extraction from website and get desired information from it without. <br><br>

To illustrate a few real-world examples such locations track changes in prices of products from websites such as Amazon or Flipkart or eBay.
<br><br>

This application is built to scrape the website https://books.toscrape.com.
Now, if you want to create any other website, you could modify the code and we write it in a way it could scrape the website you want it to.
<br>
Happy Learning!!<br><br>
Kind Regards,<br>
